        <h4>How It All Began</h4>
        <p>Locallaunch was envisioned by 6 students at the Richard Ivey School of Business and was designed to address the needs of recent immigrants to Canada. Through numerous interviews it became apparent that although every new immigrant has a unique story and ambitions for their future, they share some similar needs. After being accepted into the country many notice that the job market doesnâ€™t recognize the same credentials that proved them worthy to Immigrations Canada. Employers may not recognize the past work experience or educational attainment of extremely intelligent and driven new members of Canadian society. Many realize that they must upgrade their postsecondary degree, take additional classes, obtain certificates, etc. To pay for their new requirements many immigrants take on jobs that do not reflect their capabilities and struggle to obtain loans from banks. Locallaunch aims to solve these issues and help Canada to realize the great potential that lies within millions of underemployed immigrants.</p>
        <h4>Our Philosophy</h4>
        <p>Locallaunch was created to help immigrants recognize their full potential by connecting them with financing from lenders want to see newcomers to Canada succeed.

To do so we are committed to maintaining communication with recent immigrants to Canada, our current users, and with the investing community.
