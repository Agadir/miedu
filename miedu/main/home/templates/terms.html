        <p>We reserve the right to reclaim usernames on behalf of businesses or individuals that hold legal claim or trademark on those usernames.</p>
        <h2>Proprietary Rights of Content</h2>
        <p>We, <strong>locallaunch</strong>, do NOT claim ANY ownership rights in the text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, musical works, works of authorship, applications, or any other materials (collectively, "Content") that you post on or through the <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services. By displaying or publishing ("posting") any Content on or through the <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services, you hereby grant to <strong>locallaunch</strong> a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, worldwide, limited license to use, modify, delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce and translate such Content, including without limitation distributing part or all of the Site in any media formats through any media channels, except Content not shared publicly ("private") will not be distributed outside the <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services.</p>
        <p>Some of the <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services are supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that <strong>locallaunch</strong> may place such advertising and promotions on the <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
        <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this section, (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any person, and (iii) the posting of your Content on the Site does not result in a breach of contract between you and a third party. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person by reason of Content you post on or through the <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services.</p>
        <p>The <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services contain Content of <strong>locallaunch</strong> ("locallaunch Content"). <strong>locallaunch</strong> Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and <strong>locallaunch</strong> owns and retains all rights in the <strong>locallaunch</strong> Content and the <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services. <strong>locallaunch</strong> hereby grants you a limited, revocable, nonsublicensable license to reproduce and display the <strong>locallaunch</strong> Content (excluding any software code) solely for your personal use in connection with viewing the Site and using the <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services.</p>
        <p>The <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services contain Content of Users and other <strong>locallaunch</strong> licensors. Except as provided within this Agreement, you may not copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, display, or sell any Content appearing on or through the <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, <strong>locallaunch</strong> performs technical functions necessary to offer the <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services, including but not limited to transcoding and/or reformatting Content to allow its use throughout the <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services.</p>
        <p>Although the Site and other <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services are normally available, there will be occasions when the Site or other <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services will be interrupted for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment that are beyond the control of <strong>locallaunch</strong>. Also, although <strong>locallaunch</strong> will normally only delete Content that violates this Agreement, <strong>locallaunch</strong> reserves the right to delete any Content for any reason, without prior notice. Deleted content may be stored by <strong>locallaunch</strong> in order to comply with certain legal obligations and is not retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, <strong>locallaunch</strong> encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, <strong>locallaunch</strong> is not a backup service. We, <strong>locallaunch</strong>, will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the <strong>locallaunch</strong> Services, or the loss of any Content.</p>

        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
              <p>Welcome to <strong>locallaunch</strong> by <strong>midroid Inc.</strong> ("locallaunch," "we," "us" or "our"). Our application is founded on the principle of helping people create new videos. We know that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy very seriously. By visiting the <strong>locallaunch</strong> website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this policy.</p>
              <h2>Information Collected</h2>
              <p>We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our application. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We collect the following types of information from our users:</p>
<h2>Information You Provide to Us</h2>
              <p>
              <ol>
              <li>We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.</li>
              <li>Registration: In order for you to use <strong>locallaunch</strong> services you must complete a registration form. As part of this registration form, we require select personal information.</li>
              <li>User Profile: To allow you to express yourself beyond just the information collected during registration, we enable you to provide additional information, such as a bio, favorite URLs, and instant messaging IDs. In addition, you may choose to include photos of yourself in your profile. As indicated below, in the section titled "Sharing Your Information", you can control how your information is displayed and used.</li>
              <li><strong>Automatic Information:</strong>
                <ul>
                <li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Both <strong>locallaunch</strong> and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, <strong>locallaunch</strong> cookie information, and the page you requested. We use this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.</li>
                <li>The application may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed. This includes User Profile pages.</li>
                <li>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While <strong>locallaunch</strong> will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              </ol>
              </p>
<h2>Email Communication</h2>
              <p>Your privacy is very much a concern at <strong>locallaunch</strong> and we will never provide your email address to a third party without your explicit permission, as detailed in the "Sharing Your Information" section below. Periodically, <strong>locallaunch</strong> may send out e-mails with <strong>locallaunch</strong>-related news, products, offers, surveys or promotions. You may also receive notification e-mails from <strong>locallaunch</strong>, which inform you of actions (e.g. friend requests) that have been performed on the site. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please visit the Email Preferences section of your User Profile and/or follow the instructions contained in the unwanted e-mail message. However, please note that in all cases you will continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g. those regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (e.g. updates to our policies) from us.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
              <p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. Our cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.</p>
              </p>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use some of midroid's coolest features. Some of our business partners, like our advertisers, may use cookies on our website. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies.</p>
<h2>Sharing your Information</h2>
              <p>Because <strong>locallaunch</strong> enables people to discover and share information with one another, information about the people who use <strong>locallaunch</strong> is an integral part of the <strong>locallaunch</strong> experience. Rest assured that we neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone and that we will share your personal information only as described below.
              <p>locallaunch Personnel: <strong>locallaunch</strong> personnel and authorized consultants and/or contractors may have access to user information if necessary in the normal course of <strong>locallaunch</strong> business.</p>
              <p>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if <strong>locallaunch</strong>, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred.</p>
              <p>Protection of <strong>locallaunch</strong> and Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of <strong>locallaunch</strong>, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
              <p>User Profile information: Information collected during registration and subsequent visits, such as your full name and location, may be displayed to other <strong>locallaunch</strong> users in your User Profile. The User Profile is the area on <strong>locallaunch</strong> where we allow you to tell other <strong>locallaunch</strong> users about yourself. You may control what personal information is displayed in your User Profile by visiting the Settings section of your User Profile.</p>
              <p>Followers' Activity: Much like other online social networks, <strong>locallaunch</strong> allows non-followers to browse your followers activity.</p>
              <p>Syndication: <strong>locallaunch</strong> allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public content within the <strong>locallaunch</strong> website.</p>
              <p>With Your Consent: Except as noted above, we will contact you when your personal information is shared with third parties or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, and you will be able to opt out to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>
<h2>Keeping Your Information Secure</h2>
              <p>Your <strong>locallaunch</strong> account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. Protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.</p>
              </p>Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.</p>
<h2>Display and Use of Information</h2>
              <p>As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information, but then you may be unable to use certain features on our website.</p>
              <p>By visiting your User Profile, you can correct, amend, add or delete personal information on our website.</p>
              <p>If you do not wish to receive e-mail from us or other <strong>locallaunch</strong> users, please visit the Settings of your User Profile and/or follow the instructions contained in the unwanted e-mail message.</p>
              <p>However, please note that you will continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g. those regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (e.g. updates to our policies) from us.</p>
              <p>As e<strong>xplained</strong> earlier, the "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to <strong>prevent</strong> your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you<strong> receive</strong> a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. Please note, however, that if your browser does not accept cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of some of our attractive features.</p>
<h2>Minors Under 18 Years of Age</h2>
              <p>You must be 14 years and older to register to use the <strong>locallaunch</strong> application. As a result, <strong>locallaunch</strong> does not specifically collect information about children. If we learn that <strong>locallaunch</strong> has collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. We recommend that minors between the ages of 14 and 18 ask and receive their parents' permission before using <strong>locallaunch</strong> or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.</p>
<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
              <p>This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time, at the sole discretion of <strong>locallaunch</strong>. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the <strong>locallaunch</strong> website so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances if any, it is disclosed.</p>
<h2>Conditions of Use</h2>
              <p>If you decide to visit <strong>locallaunch</strong> website, your visit and any possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of Ontario law.</p>
<h2>Effective Date of This Policy</h2>
              <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of September 12, 2012</p>
